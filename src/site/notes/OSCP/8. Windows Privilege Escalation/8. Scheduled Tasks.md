- Windows uses the Task Scheduler to execute various automated tasks.
- They are executed on triggers, which are conditions set to a specific time or event.
- An action specifies which program or script to execute.
- Three vital pieces of information about tasks:
	- As which user account (principal) does this task get executed?
	- What triggers are specified for the task?
	- What actions are executed when one or more of these triggers are met?

### Scheduled Task Privesc
1. Enumerate scheduled tasks:
```powershell
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```
2. Check permissions of the directory of the wanted binary to replace with 'icacls'.
3. Win!

-------
### Enumeration Queries:

Windows Tasks Exclude Directory Search Query:
``` powershell
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | findstr /v /c:"system32" /c:"root"

Get-ScheduledTask | findstr /v /i /c:"\Microsoft\Windows"
```
- Can add multiple "/c:" for multiple parameters
- Remove /v to filter for instead of excluding
- /i makes it case-sensitive

One-liner to show binary paths only and exclude system32 and com handler (should work well):
``` powershell
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | findstr /B /C:"Task To Run" | findstr /v /c:"root" /c:"System32" /c:"system32" /c:"COM"
```
