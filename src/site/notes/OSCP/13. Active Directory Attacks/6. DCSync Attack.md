---------
- Domain controllers typically rely on more than one DC for redundancy.
- Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol uses "replication" to synchronize.
- A domain controller may request an update for a specific object using the "IDL_DRSGetNCChanges" API.
- Issuing an object update request from a user with certain privileges will work even though its not coming from a DC.
- To launch a replication the user needs rights to:
	- _Replicating Directory Changes_
	- _Replicating Directory Changes All_ 
	- _Replicating Directory Changes in Filtered Set_
- Normally, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Administrator groups have these rights, which will let them perform a "dcsync attack" to request any user hashes.
