## SUID:
- To allow for users without permissions to access files such as /etc/shadow when changing their password effective UIDs are used.
- The real UID/GID is the one of the initiating script
- Inspect process using eUID:
``` bash
ps u -C passwd
```
- Inspecting the UIDs:
```bash
grep Uid /proc/<PID>/status
```
- Find SUID binaries:
```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
```
- Instead of 'x' an 's' represents setuid for a specified file, such as: ![Pasted image 20230801111545.png|525](/img/user/IMAGES/Pasted%20image%2020230801111545.png)
- If the SUID bit is set for execute that script or binary will always be executed as root
- Can be set with:
``` bash
chmod u+s <filename>
```

------
## Capabilities:
- More fine-grained privilege mechanism introduced in modern kernels
- Instead of giving an entire program elevated privileges, capabilities allow for only individual permissions instead of full root
1. Searching for capabilities:
```
/usr/sbin/getcap -r / 2>/dev/null
```
2. Search for the resulted capabilities in GTFOBins!
	https://gtfobins.github.io/
3. Exploit and win!

----------------
## Sudo:
	sudo -l
- Applications may be protected by AppArmor, check status with:
	aa-status
- Use GTFOBins!

----------
## Kernel:
1. Enumerate the OS, kernel and architecture:
```
cat /etc/issue
uname -r
arch
```
2. Craft a searchsploit query and find a good exploit:
```
searchsploit "linux kernel Ubuntu 16 Local Privilege Escalation" | grep "4." | grep -v " < 4.4.0" | grep -v "4.8"
```
3. Compile the exploit to match the correct architecture and look out for compiling instructions. If possible wait to compile it on target machine itself.
4. Transfer the binary to the target machine using SCP:
```
scp cve-2017-16995.c joe@192.168.123.216:
```
5. Inspect the file to see if everything is correct before running, especially the architecture:
```
file cve-2017-16995
```
6. Exploit and win!
