### 2. Testing summary
- High level overview of each step of engagement
- Includes:
	- Severity
	- Context
	- Worst-case scenario
- Note any trends observed to provide strategic advice
- Mention things done well
- No absolute claims, eg. don't use "impossible"
- Ending with engagement wrap-up
Example:
