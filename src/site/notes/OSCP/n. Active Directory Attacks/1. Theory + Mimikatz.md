---------
## NTLM:
- Client authenticates to server by IP address instead of hostname.

- NTLM uses a fast-hashing algorithm, so with very good equipment one can test over 600 billion hashes every second.
- NTLM is still commonly used as a fallback mechanism for many third-party applications.

----------
## Kerberos:
- Microsofts primary authentication mechanism.
- Uses a ticket system.
- The client starts the authentication process against the Key Distribution Center (KDC) no the domain controller, and not the application server itself.

---------------
## Cached AD Credentials:
- Cached password hashes for Kerberos request renewals are stored in the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) memory space.
- To dump LSASS one needs SYSTEM or local admin privileges
- Avoid running Mimikatz as a standalone application to avoid detection. Instead execute it from memory or dump the entire LSASS memory from Task Manager and do things locally.
- Additional registry keys may prevent reading windows memory and dumping LSASS, which makes it harder.
- On older Windows 7 systems where WDigest is enabled, running Mimikatz will reveal cleartext passswords along hashes.
Dumping LSASS using Mimikatz:
1. Run Mimikatz
2. Engage SeDebugPrivilege:
```
privilege::debug
```
3. Dump credentials for logged on users:
```
sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```
