## Payloads:
- List compatible payloads:
```
show payloads
```
- '/' means the payload is staged
	- eg. _shell_reverse_tcp_ vs. _shell/reverse_tcp_
## Meterpreter
- Resides entirely in memory and is encrypted
- Can allow for multiple channels of shells:
```
#Create shell:
shell

#Background channel:
ctrl + z

#List channels:
channel -l

#Interact with channel:
channel -i <id>
```
- To simultaneously interact with the local kali system prepend 'l' for common commands, eg. "lls, lpwd, lcd, lcat"
- Using a HTTPS listener instead encrypts the communication, and the page hosting the payload only shows a 404 page not found
- Search for file with Metepreter:
```
search -f <filename>
```
