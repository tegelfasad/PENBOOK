---------
- AD and other directory services use the LDAP protocol
- LDAP path prototype:
```
LDAP://HostName[:PortNumber][/DistinguishedName]
```
- Hostname:
	- Could be replaced with computer name, ip address or a domain name
	- However it is a good idea to resolve to the DC which holds the most updated information (Primary Domain Controller, PDC) if there are multiple
	- Enumerate PDC
	- ``[System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
- Port number:
	- Optional
- Distinguished name:
	- Uniquely identifies an object in AD
	- Example distinguished name (DN):
		CN=Stephanie,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com
	- CN = Common Name
	- DC = Domain Component
	- Goes from highest in hierarchy (right) to lowest (left)

------------
### Powershell Script to obtain LDAP path:
```powershell
$PDC = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
$DN = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName 
$LDAP = "LDAP://$PDC/$DN"
$LDAP
```

-----------------
### Powershell script to enumerate domain objects:
```powershell
function LDAPSearch {
    param (
        [string]$LDAPQuery
    )

    $PDC = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain().PdcRoleOwner.Name
    $DistinguishedName = ([adsi]'').distinguishedName

    $DirectoryEntry = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry("LDAP://$PDC/$DistinguishedName")

    $DirectorySearcher = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher($DirectoryEntry, $LDAPQuery)

    return $DirectorySearcher.FindAll()

}
```
Usage:
``` powershell
#Activate script:
powershell -ep bypass
Import-Module .\scrip.ps1

#Search according to samAccountType:
LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(samAccountType=<decimalvalue>)"

#Search according to objectclass:
LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(objectclass=group)"

#Searching for specified CN content:
$sales = LDAPSearch -LDAPQuery "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn=Sales Department))"
$sales.properties.member
```
