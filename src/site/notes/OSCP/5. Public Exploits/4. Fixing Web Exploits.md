Good questions to ask yourself when reviewing web exploit code:
- Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection?
- Does it access a specific web application path or route?
- Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?
- If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?
- How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability? Is there any HTTP method involved?
- Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
- Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?
