---------
### System awareness:

Enumerate user and groups:
```
id
```

Enumerate all users:
```
cat /etc/passwd
```
- Which users exist can tell something about which services are available, such as user "www-data" for Apache, and "sshd" for SSH
- System services users often have home folders as /usr/sbin/nologin to block any login for that account

Hostname:
```
hostname
```

System info:
```
uname -a

cat /etc/issue

cat /etc/os-release
```

Mountable drives:
```
#Drives mounted at boot (may not include user-created scripts):
cat /etc/fstab

#All mounted filesystems:
mount

#List all available disks:
lsblk
```

Running processes:
```
ps aux
```

TCP/IP configuration:
```
ip a

ifconfig
```

Network routing tables:
```
ip route

route

routel
```

Active network connections and listening ports:
```
ss -anp

netstat -anp
```

Listening ports:
```
netstat -tulnp
```

Installed applications:
- Debian distros use dpkg and Redhat uses rpm
```
#Debian:
dpkg -l
```

Kernel modules:
```
#List loaded kernel modules:
lsmod

#Inspect specific module:
/sbin/modinfo <modulename>
```

AppArmor status:
```
aa-status
```

Firewall enumeration:
- iptables requires root user
- However, specific rule files under */etc/iptables* are used to restore netfilter rules at boot, which often have weaker permissions
- Also, files created by the iptables-save command can be searched
```
cat /etc/iptables/*
```
-------------
### Cronjobs:
```
# Cronjobs for all users
ls -lah /etc/cron*

#User-created cronjobs for the current user
crontab -l

#Running cronjobs:
grep "CRON" /var/log/syslog
cat /var/log/cron.log
```
- If let use sudo to list root cronjobs as well
----------
### Writable directories & files:

Writable  directories:
```
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
```

Writable files:
```
find / -writable -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v proc | grep -v gnupg
```
----------
### SUID binaries:

SUID-marked binaries:
```
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
