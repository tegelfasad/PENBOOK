-----------
- Isolated applications can use a set of predefined service accounts, such as: LocalSystem, LocalService, and NetworkService
- When applications such as Exchange and MS SQL are integrated in AD, the Service Principal Name (SPN) associates each service to a specific service account
- By enumerating SPNs in the domain one can see running applications and ports
- This could be done using the setspn.exe lolbin or using PowerView
Usage:
```
#Using setspn.exe:
setspn -L <user>

#Using PowerView:
Get-NetUser -SPN | select samaccountname,serviceprincipalname
```

Then perform lookup for the host results to see on which IPs the services are running:
```
nslookup.exe <hostname>
```
